# year-document-link-00
Template repository for HTML link redirect

<b>Purpose</b>
<br>
This is a template repository to be used to set up custom HTML link redirects. Use this template repository when you require links in a document where links may later change or require update.

<b>Instructions</b>
1. Open the index.html file found in this template repository and copy the html code to your clipboard.
2. Create a new repository in GitHub and name it using the convention year-document-link-00. For example, "2021-afsufreport-link-01" where "01" is a sequential number order starting at 01 and continuing up through as many links that are created for the document.
3. In the new repository you just created, make a new file and name it "index.html".
4. Paste in the html code you'd previously copied to your clipboard into the index.html file.
5. Edit the url which appears in the "meta" tag under the "head" section to be whichever web address you'd like to direct the link. Be sure to commit (save) the changes.
6. Repeat steps 1 through 6 for each individual link needed.

If and when a link changes after a document has been published, individual links can be redirected by returning to the appropriate GitHub repository and updating the url to a new web address per step 5 above.
